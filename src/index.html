    <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Django Reinhardt's life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1910</strong> - Reinhardt was born on 23 January 1910 in Liberchies, Pont-Ã -Celles, Belgium</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1928</strong> - Recorded for the first time! (Three records), and he played the banjo-guitar on these recordings. 
        This is also the year where Django has his accident, that almost killed him.
       
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1929</strong> - Bella Mayer (his wife) gave birth to their son, Henri "Lousson" Reinhardt. Soon thereafter, the couple split up. The son eventually took the surname of his mother's new husband. As Lousson Baumgartner, the son himself became an accomplished musician who went on to record with his biological father.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1934</strong> - Reinhardt and Grappelli worked together as the principal soloists of their newly formed quintet, the Quintette du Hot Club de France, in Paris.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1935</strong> - Decca Records in the United States released three records of Quintette tunes with Reinhardt on guitar, and one other, credited to "Stephane Grappelli & His Hot 4 with Django Reinhardt".
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1943</strong> - Reinhardt married his long-term partner Sophie "Naguine" Ziegler in Salbris. They had a son, Babik Reinhardt, who became a respected guitarist.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1947</strong> -  Having failed to bring his usual Selmer ModÃ¨le Jazz, he played on a borrowed electric guitar, which he felt hampered the delicacy of his style.[11]:â€Š138â€Š He had been promised jobs in California, but they failed to develop. Tired of waiting, Reinhardt returned to France in February 1947.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1949</strong> - In Rome in 1949, Reinhardt recruited three Italian jazz players (on bass, piano, and snare drum) and recorded over 60 tunes in an Italian studio. He united with Grappelli, and used his acoustic Selmer-Maccaferri. The recording was issued for the first time in the late 1950s.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1951</strong> - Reinhardt retired to Samois-sur-Seine, near Fontainebleau, where he lived until his death. He continued to play in Paris jazz clubs and began playing electric guitar. (He often used a Selmer fitted with an electric pickup, despite his initial hesitation about the instrument.) In his final recordings, made with his Nouvelle Quintette in the last few months of his life, he had begun moving in a new musical direction, in which he assimilated the vocabulary of bebop and fused it with his own melodic style.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1953</strong> - while walking from the Gare de Fontainebleauâ€“Avon Station after playing in a Paris club, he collapsed outside his house from a brain hemorrhage.[11]:â€Š160â€Š It was a Saturday, and it took a full day for a doctor to arrive.[11]:â€Š161â€Š Reinhardt was declared dead on arrival at the hospital in Fontainebleau, at the age of 43.

        "First of all, his instrumental technique is vastly superior to that of all other jazz guitarists. This technique permits him to play with an inconceivable velocity and makes his instrument completely versatile. Though his virtuosity is stupefying, it is no less so than his creative invention. In his solos [...] his melodic ideas are sparkling and ravishing, and their abundance scarcely gives the listener time to catch his breath. Django's ability to bend his guitar to the most fantastic audacities, combined with his expressive inflections and vibrato, is no less wonderful; one feels an extraordinary flame burning through every note."
